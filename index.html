<p>With the onset of COVID-19, more and more people are finding creative ways to exercise at home. With so many people adapting and preferring at-home workouts, this could become a new reality and norm over the conventional gym routine.</p>

<p>Without a personal trainer or experience in a regimented training program, it can be hard to know what kinds of exercises, sets, variations, etc. to do to reach your goals. Even with thousands of dollars of equipment, without a proper plan, you won't know how to achieve your fitness goals.</p>

<p>While personal trainers are great, even through a digital platform like Zoom or FaceTime, they can be incredibly expensive. There are lots of sites that give people recipes for random food items in their pantry, so why can't there be something similar for people who want to get in shape?</p>

<p>By using a similar model as recipe generators, people can access a kind of workout regimen generator. By using simple inputs like types of exercises they want to implement (cardio, balance work, sports-specific movements, bodybuilding, strength building, etc.) and what kinds of equipment they have access to (jump rope, pool, track, barbells, cable machine, etc.) we can develop a more robust, straightforward, and simple tool where everyone can have access to a quality workout plan to reach their fitness goals.</p>
